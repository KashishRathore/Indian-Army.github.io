         <h1>History Behind Indian Army Day</h1>
         The historical happy Indian Army day commemorates when Field Marshal Kodandera M. Cariappa succeeded
         the
         British Army
         General Roy Butcher in 1949 and accepted his new role as the first Commander-in-Chief of independent
         India.
         India became an independent nation after gaining freedom from British rulers in 1945 after almost 200
         years.
         During that
         time, the country was experiencing a lot of chaos & riots as many refugees and people were migrating
         from
         Pakistan.
         This administrative disorder compelled the need for an army invasion to control the situation so that
         peace
         could be
         established during the partition. During independent India, the reins of the nation's army were
         controlled
         by the
         British officer Francis Butcher. This was when the British General gave Field Marshal Kodandera M.
         Cariappa
         the
         management of the country,s army.
         Hence, happy Indian Army day has been celebrated to recognise his role in managing the Indian army. In other words, we
are celebrating the day when the control of the national army gets transferred to an Indian citizen.

               and Arunachal Pradesh. The Chinese and Indian troops made incursions beyond the disputed McMahon Line
               increasing the tensions. But India lost footing in the war because of poor coordination among various
               divisions of the Indian Army, andthe late decision to mobilize the Indian Air Force gave China a crucial
               tactical and strategic advantage over India.The Line of Actual Control (LAC) came into being after this.

               The LAC is generally divided into three sectors:

               The western sector between Ladakh on the Indian side and the Tibet and Xinjiang autonomous
               regions on the Chinese side.
               The middle, mostly-undisputed sector between Uttrakhand and Himachal Pradesh on the Indian
               side
               and the Tibet autonomous
               region on the Chinese side.

               region
