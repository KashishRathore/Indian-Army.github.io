        <h2>Commissioned Officer</h2>
        <p class="content-description">Commissioned officers are the army's highest ranked officers. They are the group
            A or class-1 service officers. Commissioned officers hold an exclusive rank in the Indian armed forces. They
            often hold a commission under the president's sovereign power and are officially instructed to protect the
            country. The president directly appoints commissioned officers and has the authority to declare war or make
            peace, subject to the parliament's consent. Commissioned officers are the Army's top leaders, commanding
            anything from a battalion, company, division, brigade or the whole army.</p>

            <h3>Field marshal</h3>
            <p>In the Indian Army, the field marshal is a five-star general officer position and is the highest rank one
                can achieve. Field marshal is a ceremonial, wartime position that ranks immediately above general. The
                marshal is paid the same as a four-star general and is considered as a serving officer until they die.

            <h3>General</h3>
            <p>A general officer is a four-star officer. The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) describes the
                rank of general by the code OF-9. It is the highest rank in many of the armies now in operation. Only
                the chief of the army staff of the Indian Army has this position. They can retire after three years of
                service as the COAS (the Chief of the Army Staff) or at the age of 62.</p>

            <h3>Lieutenant general</h3>
            <p>A lieutenant general holds a three-star military rank in the Indian Army. Military officers who have
                completed 36 years of commissioned service can undergo a selection process to become lieutenant general.
                They are the vice chief of Army staff and often act as Army commanders, retiring at the age of 60.</p>

            <h3>Major general</h3>
            <p>The position of major general is equivalent to the earlier rank of sergeant major general. Their rank is
                higher than that of a brigadier and lower than that of a lieutenant general. The major general post in
                the Indian Army is similar to the air vice-marshal post in the Indian Air Force and the rear admiral
                post in the Indian Navy. To become a major general, one has to complete 32 years of commissioned service
                in the Indian military and clear a thorough selection process. These officers retire at the age of 58
                years.</p>

            <h3>Brigadier</h3>
            <p>Brigadiers hold a one-start rank in the Indian Army. The position of brigadier is comparable to that of
                an air commodore in the Indian Air Force and a commodore in the Indian Navy. To hold the position of
                brigadier, one has to complete 25 years of commissioned service in the Indian military. Their retirement
                age by law is 56.</p>

            <h3>Colonel</h3>
            <p>A colonel's rank in the Indian Army is similar to that of a captain in the Indian Navy and a group
                captain in the Indian Air Force. Colonels rank one level above lieutenant colonels and one level below
                brigadiers. Colonels are appointed through a selection process among military officers who have
                completed a minimum of 15 years of commissioned service. Their retirement age by law is 54.</p>

        <p class="content-description">A non-commissioned officer (NCO) is a military officer who has yet to earn a rank
            or commission. These individuals hold leadership positions within their units, but they rank lower than
            commissioned officers. Tasked with helping to execute the vast majority of military missions, they're
            responsible for fulfilling their individual duties and ensuring that they accomplish all missions as a team.
            Higher-ranking officers may select NCOs to take the lead in various aspects of a mission based on their
            unique strengths and weaknesses. There are officer ranks within the NCO rank, like a warrant officer (WO),
            who rank higher than other NCOs but below commissioned officers.</p>

            <h3>Havildar</h3>
            <p>Havildars could be further appointed to positions of higher authority. The appointments of company
                quartermaster havildar and company havildar major existed in the British Indian Army.[2] Historically,
                the two senior-most havildars of a company became the CQMH and the CHM. However, these were just
                appointments and the commanding officer could promote or demote any of these ranks at his discretion.[2]
                These appointments still technically exist in the modern Indian Army.[3] However, havildars are now
                promoted directly to junior commissioned officer rank, as the duties of these historical appointments
                are now carried out by JCOs.</p>

            <h3>Naik</h3>
            <p>The rank was previously used in the British Indian Army and the Camel Corps, ranking between lance naik
                and havildar. In cavalry units, the equivalent is lance daffadar. Like a British corporal, a naik wears
                two rank chevrons.</p>

            <h3>Lance Naik</h3>
            <p>Lance naik (L/Nk) is the equivalent rank to lance corporal in the Indian armies and before 1947, in the
                British Indian Army, ranking below naik. In cavalry units the equivalent is acting lance daffadar. Like
                British lance corporals, each wears a single rank chevron.</p>

            <h3>Sepoy</h3>
            <p>The term sepoy came into common use in the forces of the British East India Company in the eighteenth
                century, where it was one of a number of names, such as peons, gentoos, mestees and topasses, used for
                various categories of native soldier. Initially it referred to Hindu or Muslim soldiers without regular
                uniforms or discipline.</p>
